    "This model has the lowest MSE, RMSE, and MAE among the models evaluated, as well as the highest R^2 score (0.143). R^2 value indicates that the model explains a modest proportion of the variance in the target, it outperforms alternatives like Gradient Boosting and XGBoost. These results suggest that LightGBM captures the target variable's underlying patterns more effectively than other models, though further improvements may be needed to enhance predictive performance across all models.\n",
