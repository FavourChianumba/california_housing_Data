## **Overview**

Housing price prediction is a critical application of machine learning, widely used in real estate, banking, and investment industries. The goal of this project is to accurately predict housing prices using historical data on housing features. By employing a variety of machine learning techniques and experimenting with advanced ensemble methods, we aim to achieve robust predictions.

---

## **Data Description**

We used a publicly available dataset called [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices). This dataset includes the following features:

1. **longitude**: A measure of how far west a house is; higher values indicate locations farther west.
2. **latitude**: A measure of how far north a house is; higher values indicate locations farther north.
3. **housingMedianAge**: Median age of houses within a block; lower values suggest newer buildings.
4. **totalRooms**: Total number of rooms within a block.
5. **totalBedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms within a block.
6. **population**: Total number of people residing within a block.
7. **households**: Total number of households (groups of people residing in home units) within a block.
8. **medianIncome**: Median income for households in a block, measured in tens of thousands of US dollars.
9. **medianHouseValue**: Median house value for households in a block, measured in US dollars.
10. **oceanProximity**: A categorical feature representing the house's location relative to the ocean (e.g., "NEAR BAY," "INLAND").

---

### **Preprocessing Steps**

#### 1. Stratified Test Splitting
To ensure a balanced division of data into training and test sets, we applied **stratified sampling** based on the `medianIncome` feature. This was crucial because `medianIncome` strongly correlates with housing prices, and an unrepresentative split could lead to skewed evaluation metrics. Here's how we performed stratified splitting:

- **Income Categories**: 
   - We divided `medianIncome` into discrete bins using a custom transformation to create a temporary feature, `income_cat`. 
   - This feature categorized `medianIncome` into five levels, with higher incomes grouped into the last category.
- **Stratification**: 
   - Using this `income_cat` feature, we applied stratified sampling to split the data while maintaining similar proportions of each income category in both the training and test sets.
- **Benefits of Stratification**: 
   - This approach ensures the test set reflects the overall dataset distribution, reducing the risk of biased performance metrics. It is especially helpful when working with medium-sized datasets or sparse feature spaces.

Finally, the `income_cat` feature was dropped after splitting to avoid data leakage into the training or test sets.

---

#### 2. Handling Categorical Features
The `oceanProximity` feature is a categorical variable containing labels like "NEAR BAY," "ISLAND," and "INLAND." These non-numeric values cannot be directly used by machine learning models like XGBoost or Ridge Regression. To handle this:

- We applied **one-hot encoding** to convert `oceanProximity` into binary features. For example, the category "NEAR BAY" was transformed into a binary column (`NEAR BAY`) where `1` indicates presence and `0` indicates absence.
- To avoid multicollinearity, we used the `drop_first=True` option, which removes one binary column as a reference. This ensures the encoded features remain independent and prevents redundancy.

This preprocessing step ensures compatibility with machine learning models and allows the models to identify patterns related to specific house locations.

---

### **Dataset Summary**
- The dataset was divided into **training (80%)** and **test (20%)** subsets using stratified sampling to preserve the distribution of the `medianIncome` feature.
- After preprocessing, the training and test sets were cleaned and encoded, making them ready for use in various machine learning models.

### **Model Selection**

#### **Chosen Model: LightGBM**
LightGBM emerged as the top-performing model based on comprehensive evaluation metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 11,574,950,000.00
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 107,587.00
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 80,157.93
- **RÂ² Score**: 0.143

#### **Selection Rationale**
The LightGBM model was selected due to its superior performance across key metrics:
- Lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Highest RÂ² Score

While the RÂ² value of 0.143 indicates that the model explains only a modest proportion of the variance in the target variable, it consistently outperformed alternative models such as Gradient Boosting and XGBoost.

### **Performance Insights**
- Most linear models (Linear Regression, RidgeCV) showed extremely poor performance with negative RÂ² scores
- Ensemble and tree-based methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM) demonstrated significantly better predictive capabilities
- The modest RÂ² score suggests complex underlying patterns in the housing price data that require further feature engineering or advanced modeling techniques

- MAE: 65,628.05
- RÂ² Score: 0.4343

### Ensemble Methods

We explored various ensemble techniques to improve model performance:

#### 1. Weighted Averaging
We tested different weight combinations between LightGBM and XGBoost:

| Weight Distribution (LGB/XGB) | RÂ² Score | RMSE | MAE |
|------------------------------|----------|------|-----|
| 0.1/0.9 | 0.4338 | 87,425.15 | 65,597.59 |
| 0.01/0.99 | 0.4343 | 87,388.28 | 65,624.25 |

#### 2. Stacking Ensembles
We implemented two stacking approaches using different meta-learners:

##### Ridge Regression Meta-learner
- Best weights: LightGBM (0.1) / XGBoost (0.9)
- MSE: 7,505,194,082.97
- RMSE: 86,632.52
- MAE: 64,812.11
- RÂ² Score: 0.4440 (Best performing model)

##### Neural Network Meta-learner
- Best weights: LightGBM (0.1) / XGBoost (0.9)
- MSE: 7,554,026,894.22
